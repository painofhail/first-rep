# Hello, World! This is my first rep!

[Link](https://painofhail.github.io/first-rep/) to the rep page.

My plans for this rep:

- [x] .editorconfig-file for rep
- [x] change git user to painofhail (git config --local)
- [x] HTML + CSS page on GitHub Pages
- [ ] add some js-code
- [ ] use package from npm
- [ ] gulp or webpack
